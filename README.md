## Introduction

Arkanoid is a video game originally published in 1986 by a Japanese company named Taito. It was made available in hand-held video games like Gameboys. It became very popular in the 90's. Arkanoid was ones known as Block Breaker.

### Objective of Arkanoid

The upper portion of the screen is populated by blocks. At the bottom of the screen is a horizontal bar which can be manouevered left or right by the player. A ball bounces across the screen. Whenever it collides with the top, left, or right edges of the screen, it is rebounded. 

The ball also rebounds from the horizontal bar itself, and from the blocks in the upper half of the screen. If it reaches the bottom half of the screen without colliding with the bar, however, a life point is lost. There are three life points in all. Loss of all life points results in Game Over.

Additionally, when the ball strikes the blocks, it causes the blocks to disappear. Whenever a block disappears, the player receives additional points in their score. Also, some blocks drop bonuses when they are made to disappear by collision with the ball.
